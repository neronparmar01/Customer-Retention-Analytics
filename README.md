# Credit-Card-Customer-Retention-Analytics
## Overview
This repository contains a dataset and Data Analytics performed for predicting customer churn in a bank's credit card services. The dataset includes information about 10,000+ customers data in main file, 8000+ data in existing customer file and 5000+ data in weaken customer file, such as their age, salary, marital status, credit card limit, and credit card category. The objective is to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn, allowing the bank to proactively engage with them and provide better services to retain them.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset is provided in three files:
- `BankChurners.csv`: The main dataset containing information about all customers.
- `Existing Customers.csv`: Data for existing customers only.
- `Weaken Customers.csv`: Data for customers who have churned.

These dataset contains around 23 featured columns such as:
- Age
- Salary
- Marital Status
- Credit Card Limit
- Credit Card Category
- And more

## Analysis
In this project, I aim to predict customer churn using Data Analytics techniques. The analysis involves:
- Exploring the dataset to understand its structure and distribution of features.
- Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices were used to identify patterns and relationships between variables.
- Examined the distribution of churned and non-churned customers to understand the imbalance in the dataset.

## Contribution
Contributions to improve the analysis or add new features are welcome. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Thank you for your interest in this project!
